# A-Star-Sharp
A small, easy to understand C# implementation of the A Star pathfinding algorithm for 2D grid based applications, and games.

In my searching, https://github.com/davecusatis couldn't find a very straightforward A Star implementation in C#, so https://github.com/davecusatis wrote one.

Supports numerical weighting of paths to give preference to certain tiles
